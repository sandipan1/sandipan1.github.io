# Work With Me


I'd love to have a chat if you're

- A startup struggling to figure out how to build more reliable evaluations for your LLM application
- working in the LLM space and would like to bounce some ideas about UX, Evals, Synthetic data or anything that's interesting to you
- Someone new to the LLM space and looking for some general advice

Here's a [cal.com link](https://cal.com/sandipanhaldar/30min) to book some time if this sounds like something you're interested with.

In exchange, I might write about some of the issues and problems we talk about - without giving specific details. If I do use content we discussed about, I'll clear it with you before publishing anything.

Reach out to me !
