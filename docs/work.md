# Work With Me

I help in the following areas : 
## Data Strategy 
- Analyse your existing data landscape and your user's information needs
- Audit existing pipelines for hidden security risks
- Architect and implement granular indexing strategies for your specific usecases
- Design and deploy robust query routing strategies
- End-to-end fine-tuning pipelines for embedding models for highly personalized retrieval
- Identify bottlenecks and performance optimization for future proof systems

## Team building 
- Stand-ups become focused on concrete experiments and metrics that is aligned with your business goals
- Hand-on training on AI Expertise for your engineering team
- Roadmap design and alignment
- Communication strategies for probabilistic systems unlike traditional software systems

## Reliable Evaluation system 
 - Implement the right evaluation metrics that aligns with your business needs 
 - Accelerate your testing from weeks to days 
 - Align LLM judges with human feedback
 - Implement statistical validation to distinguish meaningful improvements from random noise
 - Benchmark architectures to quantify tradeoffs between cost, latency, and accuracy
 - Synthetic test data to systematically target edge cases and failure modes without exposing sensitive user data
 - Optimize experiment costs – Cache API results, test on subsets first, and prune dead-end experiments early

## Improve RAG systems
 - Pinpoint retrieval weaknesses by segmenting user queries by topic, intent to diagonise system failure
 - Structure data – Extract metadata, tables, and visual context to enable precise filtering.
- Automatically direct requests to specialized tools (SQL engines, image indexes, codebases)
- Fine-tune embeddings and re-rankers using real user feedback to align outputs with domain-specific needs.
- Build user-driven validation (thumbs-up/down, error highlighting) and guardrails for systematic upgrades.

## Who This Is For:

- Startups losing customers to unreliable AI
- Teams struggling with slow, untrustworthy apps
- Engineering leaders tired of “Why are we still debating this?” meetings

Here's a [cal.com link](https://cal.com/sandipanhaldar/30min) to book some time if this sounds like something you're interested with.

In exchange, I might write about some of the issues and problems we talk about - without giving specific details. If I do use content we discussed about, I'll clear it with you before publishing anything.
