## Building Your RAG Evaluation Foundation

Evaluating RAG systems is challenging, especially when you're just starting out. This notebook introduces a practical approach to assessment using synthetic data generation - a crucial first step before diving into more complex metrics.

## Why This Matters

Traditional RAG evaluation focuses on generated content quality, but this approach has significant drawbacks:

| Aspect | Content Generation | Retrieval Metrics |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Speed | 1-10s per test | 10-800ms per test |
| Cost | $100s per run | Negligible |
| Objectivity | Subjective | Quantitative |
| Iteration Speed | Hours | Minutes |
| Scale | Limited | Automated |

Instead, we'll focus on retrieval metrics that are:
- Fast to compute (milliseconds vs seconds)
- Objective and reproducible
- Easy to automate
- Cost-effective at scale

## Comprehensive Evaluation Framework

The key pillars of a evaluation framework :
1. **Synthetic Data Generation**
   - Create diverse, realistic test questions
   - Generate comprehensive datasets without real user data
   - Learn techniques for systematic question generation

2. **Maintain Query Diversity**
   - Identify different types of questions to test
   - Cover various query patterns and edge cases
   - Build representative test scenarios

3. **Evaluation Setup**
   - Establish measurement foundations
   - Set up automated testing pipelines
   - Create reproducible evaluation workflows



  When building RAG systems, intuition isn't enough - we need objective metrics to guide our decisions. Teams often waste resources on complex architectures without clear evidence they outperform simpler approaches.

## Evaluating and Comparing different retrieval strategies

   Consider this common scenario: Your team is debating whether to add a re-ranker to your retrieval pipeline. The re-ranker promises better results but adds *latency and cost*. Without objective metrics, you might invest in unnecessary complexity.
