# Who am I

Hi, I’m Sandipan Haldar.

I help businesses build and deploy AI systems that drive efficiency, automation, and smarter decision-making. By specializing in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), AI evaluation systems, and fine-tuning models, I help organizations improve information retrieval, optimize decision-making, and reduce operational costs.

## How I do Help
- **Smarter AI Systems**: I design and optimize AI-driven retrieval systems that deliver accurate, relevant, and fast responses—whether for customer support, internal knowledge bases, or personalized recommendations.
- **Cost & Efficiency Gains**: By fine-tuning AI models and optimizing retrieval strategies, businesses can achieve higher accuracy with fewer resources, reducing cloud costs and manual effort.
- **Systematic AI Evaluation**: I build evaluation frameworks that ensure AI systems perform reliably in real-world conditions, preventing costly deployment failures.
- **Structured Data Integration**: I help companies leverage metadata, SQL-based queries, and multi-modal AI to handle complex queries, particularly in e-commerce, finance, and enterprise applications.

My Background

I worked at [HRS](https://www.hrs.com/) for three years, leading AI workflows, data infrastructure, and pipeline automation to optimize business operations. Before that, I worked as a Data Scientist at various startups, helping organizations use AI to improve decision-making and operational efficiency.

Let’s Talk AI Strategy

I work with business leaders, product teams, and AI practitioners to deploy practical AI solutions that drive measurable impact. If you’re looking to integrate AI into your operations, optimize existing AI systems, or explore new AI-driven opportunities,let’s talk.
