# Who am I


You’re not just looking for another consultant. You need someone who’s been in the trenches.

I’m **Sandipan Haldar**, an Applied AI Consultant who’s spent 4+ years designing data pipelines and deploying models for companies like [HRS](https://www.hrs.com/) and fast-growing startups.
While leading AI projects, I noticed a pattern: businesses either treat AI like a software sprint or chase technical metrics that don’t move the needle. Teams burn cycles on:

- Debating solutions instead of testing them, while customers churn over slow, hallucination-prone AI

- Building "impressive" features users don’t need (like training models to “talk like pirates”) while latency drives users away

- Organizing data in ways that sabotage security and recall (like the "big pile of records" that leaks user data)

- Optimizing RAG systems backwards - using bigger embedding models/rerankers without first asking “What are users actually asking? 

- Rotating around different tools and not make any real progress

That’s why I shifted to consulting—to help companies like yours:

- Stop losing customers with RAG systems that balance accuracy, speed, and compliance

- Cut decision paralysis by replacing endless debates with clear evaluation frameworks

- Turn engineers into AI leaders in weeks, not years, using hand-on experience

- Fix hidden bottlenecks causing latency and hallucinations, from broken data pipelines to untracked model drift

- Turn technical wins into business outcomes: Like the client who used AI to prevent $50k/month in communication delays (not just “improved recall”)

I don't just give advice — I do the work too
